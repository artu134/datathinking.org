# Do
- [ ] Go to the edge of a map you interact with regularly and document it in some way (experience report, Polycam app to 3D/LiDAR scan it -- a free [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/polycam-lidar-3d-scanner/id1532482376), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.polycam) app). 
> This could be the map of a electric scooter app being tested in a neighborhood as in [this example](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU_yLxZZV6EAAD9LqsWq-P2tG1Oxr-7sf), the edge of a subway/transit map, the limits of Google Maps' search (e.g. try searching for `tacos` versus `taqueria` and see if you can find the rough edges of the resulting maps). 
> Your choice to interpret a "map" as you see fit. 
> As you document, reflect on who gets to make it, whether algorithms and data are in play, whether you trust the map reflects reality, and whether and how you get to have a say in making the map (if, for example, you disagree with how it reflects reality!). 
> Include a description of all the steps you'd need to go through to influence the edge of the map being redrawn and by whom.

# Read
- [ ] Read data thinking class notes on the ethics of exporting and sharing Zulip data -- https://github.com/onefact/datathinking.org-codespace/blob/acb3f0e2a6665d71ba3f7a973cb430ac1b682ab9/notebooks/university-of-tartu/230316-embeddings-text-data-like-chat-logs-and-networks.ipynb
> We decided to keep this a public chat to enable future students to benefit from previous students' experience, and to be able to make the data we generate easier to analyze and teach from. 
> (datathinking.zulipchat.com is a web-public stream, described here: https://zulip.com/help/public-access-option). Feel free to share any reflections about this on Zulip or over email! This is a constantly evolving open source bootcamp that depends on your feedback and experience.

# Do
- [ ] Use the Jupyter notebook from lecture to visualize the Zulip chat data to answer a question you might have about it, and post a screenshot on Zulip -- Jupyter notebook: https://github.com/onefact/datathinking.org-codespace/blob/main/notebooks/princeton-university/week-3-zulip-chat-data-analysis.ipynb
- [ ] Use homebrew to install `rectangle` on Mac (https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/rectangle) or use Chocolatey to install `powertoys` on Windows (https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/powertoys, documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/fancyzones)) and try using either to rearrange windows with keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Test using `maccy` on Mac or `copyq` on Windows for clipboard management (try using the keyboard shortcut to, for example, copy and paste some experience reports from datathinking.zulipchat.com into a large language model)
