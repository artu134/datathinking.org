**This pilot course focuses on the `feel`, `ask`, `do`, `think` workflow to guide practitioners of data thinking from data to decisions.**

Premise:

You don't trust numbers.

But you need numbers to make decisions. 

Numbers, represented on a computer, must be finite: computers do not have infinite memory. 

Further, the universe is expanding: one can never out-compete the second law of thermodynamics, stating that entropy (read: "randomness") must increase. 

These constraints make it necessary to find fast algorithms to process data in order to find patterns in this data.

These patterns are the basis of data thinking. 

Crucially, data thinking requires understanding of the stories behind the humans that collected, measured, curated, and disseminated or data used to inform decisions. These stories help understand what was included, what was excluded, and what could reasonably be expected of a particular dataset. 

Further, data thinking requires visualization. 

Finally, asking for help is hard for all of us. 

The first basic principle of data thinking is to `ask`: 

* to ask for help
* to ask a research question
* to ponder
* to ask why, how, and what for. 

The course is oriented around the `feel`, `ask`, `do`, `think` workflow. 

Concepts from psychology make an appearance, such as self-monitoring, or noticing emotional responses to verbal stimuli (such as thoughts or words associated with an experience). These basic tools can help accelerate learning and expose learners to uncertainty in an environment of psychological safety. 

Such exposure to difficult, confusing contexts is vital for helping a learner traverse and navigate the tricky process of asking, answering, or refuting questions with data. Numbers are needed to make decisions, but numbers are not enough. 

Based on open-ended elicitation of learner feedback, Claude (a large language model built by Anthropic, whose Series B round was led by Sam Bankman-Fried) summarized the following operational definition:

```
> Based on these learner definitions, here is an operational definition of "data thinking" for our class:
> 
> Data thinking is the mental process of analyzing, interpreting, and deriving meaning from data in order to understand and make decisions about the world. It involves:
> * Converting data into information and knowledge through logical and sometimes creative thinking. This includes categorizing, computing, reasoning, rationalizing, as well as making correlations and intuiting causation.
> * Asking questions about how the data was collected and making assumptions in order to comprehend its meaning. This includes considering what is included or excluded and why.
> * Connecting datasets and individual data points together through grouping, categorizing, and storytelling in order build a coherent understanding.
> * Translating data insights into subjective experiences and using them to explain, predict, gain perspective, or make judgements about real-world phenomenon.
> * Recognizing that data and thinking are interconnected and co-constructed. Data both shapes and is shaped by how we think about and make sense of the world.
> * Continually optimizing and reconsidering one's mental models in light of new data. Data thinking is an iterative process of reframing one's understanding.
> * In summary, data thinking is the active, inquisitive, and meaning-making cognitive process of understanding the world through data. It is a skill that can be developed and honed over time with practice.
```

Throughout the course, learners create, collect, analyze, visualize, and interpret their experiences and data, and learn state-of-the-art artificial intelligence methods to automate these processes. For example, `ChatGPT`, `GPT-4`, `Claude`, `Bing Chat`, and `Bard` are all used to help learners get unstuck faster than one instructors' limited resources are able to support.

Testimonials from learners:

Testimonials from the Data Thinking course I teach to cover my rent:

_"And again, this has to be one of the best courses I took. Not only because of the subject, but the whole vibe is quite different for some reason, great work! :)"_ - continuing education learner in Estonia

_"This is the most interesting class I have ever taken in 4 years. Thanks a lot, Jaan for making it engaging_ - learner in Estonia, Master's in Finance

_“I had to take some time off. During that time, I also thought about the "it" factor of this course for me. The main reason is probably that it resembles more of the real world:_
* _Things break._
* _You get frustrated after some time._
* _At the next moment, you feel complete joy because you solved the problem and found such a simple solution that it feels like it shouldn't even be possible._
* _The things are not cleaned and prepped. Other courses give you the tidy data and the assignment with clear instructions on how to make it. In some cases, after completing the assignment, it feels like "What was the point of it all?" It almost feels like training the human to write the code like a computer but not taking into account all the errors that may come up on the way to the result or questioning the ways to improve the result or the certainty of it."_

Pascal writes: 

> Here are a couple of things I would recommend:
1. Take a high-level approach and look at the FAIRification process: https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/fairification-process/. Then take a dataset through that process.
2. When you hit step 6 around capturing metadata, maybe dive a bit deeper and start with version 2 of the Data Documentation Initiative, which is essentially a rich data dictionary with extended information about the study. 
The IHSN website has tools and documentation on that topic like  https://www.ihsn.org/projects/DDI-standard and http://ihsn.org/archiving
4. To put this in practice, I would use this Guide for Data Archivists: https://guide-for-data-archivists.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. Use DDI 2 as your template.

Guest lecture: Stephan Zheng ([www.stephanzheng.com](www.stephanzheng.com)) is an AI researcher who has been developing the Al Economist, a multi-agent RL framework for economics. Most recently, he led a research team at Salesforce Research. Previously, he also worked on imitation learning, modeling cooperation, and robustness in deep learning and multi-agent games. His research has been published in leading machine learning conferences and scientific journals, including Science Advances, and has led to multiple patents. It has also been widely covered in US and international media, e.g., the Financial Times, MIT Tech Review, Forbes, Volkskrant, podcasts, and Dutch radio. He has served as an area chair for NeurIPS and ICML. Before machine learning, Stephan studied math and theoretical physics at Utrecht University, Harvard University, and the University of Cambridge, receiving the Lorenz graduation prize for his thesis on exotic dualities in topological string theory. He then switched to machine learning research during his PhD at Caltech. He is originally from the Netherlands.
